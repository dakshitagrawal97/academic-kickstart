Visited as SN Bose Scholar:

* Worked on learning trainable 3D visual representation for robot control.
* The whole code was written on Nvidia FleX, a simulator which runs completely on the GPU, hence decreasing sampling time of the
replay buffers while training RL agents.

Visited the Video Analytics Lab during the winters:

* Developed a top-down multi-generator model which use a hierarchical divisive strategy to address discontinuous multi-modal data.
* Developed novel mode splitting algorithm to effectively split the parent node to semantically cohesive children nodes, facilitating unsupervised clustering.
* Built multi-generator model such that incremental addition of new data modes to an already trained GAN-Tree is possible, by updating only a single branch of the tree structure.
* First top-down approach in the field of multi-generator models which does not require prior definition of the number of generators."""

Worked remotely as a summer intern:

* Developed an end-to-end model to learn scenic and facial features jointly using attention mechanisms for identifying the emotion
portrayed by an image of a group of people.
* The model was submitted to ICMI 2018 EmotiW Group-Level Emotion Recognition Challenge and achieved 4th rank among all participants. A short paper for the same was also accepted in the challenge.
