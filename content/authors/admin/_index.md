Hi, I am Dakshit, a senior B. Tech. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee. I will be graduating in 2020.

I am broadly interested in deep learning, with applications at the intersection of computer vision, reinforcement learning and natural language processing.
